    "## Question: \"How did the technological advancements during the Industrial Revolution impact urbanization and social structures?\"\n",
    "## Context: \"The Industrial Revolution, which took place between the 18th and 19th centuries, brought major technological advancements. Innovations such as the steam engine, mechanized textile production, and improved transportation systems revolutionized manufacturing. These changes led to rapid urbanization, as large numbers of people migrated from rural areas to cities for work, resulting in significant shifts in social structures and labor practices.\" \n",
    "## Generated Answer: \"The technological advancements during the Industrial Revolution, including the steam engine and mechanized production, dramatically increased manufacturing efficiency. This efficiency spurred rapid urbanization by drawing large populations from rural areas into cities in search of work. Consequently, traditional social structures were transformed, and new labor practices emerged as a direct result of these urban migrations.\" \n",

    "## Question: \"What benefits do renewable energy technologies offer, and what challenges must be addressed to ensure their successful implementation?\" \n",
    "## Context: \"Recent developments in renewable energy have underscored the potential of technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines to reduce carbon emissions. Despite these advances, challenges such as efficient energy storage and ensuring a stable power supply during periods of low production continue to hinder widespread adoption. Ongoing research and investment are seen as crucial to overcoming these hurdles and fully realizing the benefits of renewable energy.\" \n",
    "## Generated Answer: \"Renewable energy technologies, like solar panels and wind turbines, offer significant benefits including the reduction of carbon emissions and a decreased reliance on fossil fuels. However, for these benefits to be fully realized, challenges such as efficient energy storage and the maintenance of a stable energy supply during low production periods must be addressed. Continued research and investment are key to overcoming these obstacles and ensuring the successful implementation of renewable energy solutions.\" \n",

    "# Example 3: \n",
    "## Question: \"In what ways has digital technology transformed modern communication?\"\n",
    "## Context: \"Digital technology has fundamentally reshaped communication in the modern era. The widespread adoption of the internet and the rise of social media platforms have enabled instant and global exchange of information. These advancements have not only transformed personal communication but also revolutionized business practices, political campaigning, and information dissemination on a global scale.\" \n",
