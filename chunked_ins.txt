or assignment and the reasons thereof, the antecedents of the assignee and the terms on which the 
assignment is made. 
(2) An insurer may, accept the transfer or assignment, or decline to act upon any endorsement made

fide or is not in the interest of the policyholder or in public interest or is for the purpose of trading of 
insurance policy. 
(3) The insurer shall, before refusing to act upon the endorsement, record in writing the reasons for 
such refusal and communicate the same to the policyholder not later than thirty days from the date of the 
policyholder giving notice of such transfer or assignment.

assignment may within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of the communication from the 
insurer containing reasons for such refusal, prefer a claim to the 
Authority.

effectual upon the execution of such endorsement or instrument duly attested but except, where the transfer 
or assignment is in favour of the insurer, shall not be operative as against an insurer, and shall not confer

delivered only at the place where the policy is being serviced.

the priority of all claims under a transfer or assignment as between persons interested in the policy; and 
where there is more than one instrument of transfer or assignment the priority of the claims under such 
instruments shall be governed by the order in which the notices referred to in sub-section (5) are delivered: 
Provided that if any dispute as to priority of payment arises as between assignees, the dispute shall be 
referred to the Authority. 
(7) Upon the receipt of the notice referred to in sub-section (5), the insurer shall record the fact of such

of such notice; and any such acknowledgement shall be conclusive evidence against the insurer that he has 
duly received the notice to which such acknowledgement 
relates. 
(8) Subject to the terms and conditions of the transfer or assignment, the insurer shall, from the date of 
the receipt of the notice referred to in sub-section (5), recognise the transferee or assignee named in the

subject to all liabilities and equities to which the transferor or assignor was subject at the date of the transfer 
or assignment and may institute any proceedings in relation to the policy, obtain a loan under the policy or 
surrender the policy without obtaining the consent of the transferor or assignor or making him a party to 
such proceedings. 
Explanation.— Except where the endorsement referred to in sub-section (1) expressly indicates that the 
assignment or transfer is conditional in terms of sub-section (10) hereunder, every assignment or transfer 
shall be deemed to be an absolute assignment or transfer and the assignee or transferee, as the case may be, 
shall be deemed to be the absolute assignee or transferee 
respectively.

assignment or transfer effected prior to the commencement of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015

person in the manner laid down by the insurer, to receive the money secured by the policy in the event of 
his death during the minority of the nominee. 
(2) Any such nomination in order to be effectual shall, unless it is incorporated in the text of the policy 
itself, be made by an endorsement on the policy communicated to the insurer and registered by him in the 
records relating to the policy and any such nomination may at any time before the policy matures for 
payment be cancelled or changed by an endorsement or a further endorsement or a will, as the case may be, 
but unless notice in writing of any such cancellation or change has been delivered to the insurer, the insurer 
shall not be liable for any payment under the policy made bona fide by him to a nominee mentioned in the 
text of the policy or registered in records of the insurer.

nomination or a cancellation or change thereof, and may charge such fee as may be specified by regulations 
for registering such cancellation or change.

a nomination: 
Provided that the assignment of a policy to the insurer who bears the risk on the policy at the time of 
the assignment, in consideration of a loan granted by that insurer on the security of the policy within its 
surrender value, or its reassignment on repayment of the loan shall not cancel a nomination, but shall affect 
the rights of the nominee only to the extent of the insurer’s interest in the policy: 
Provided further that the transfer or assignment of a policy, whether wholly or in part, in consideration 
of a loan advanced by the transferee or assignee to the policyholder, shall not cancel the nomination but 
shall affect the rights of the nominee only to the extent of the interest of the transferee or assignee, as the 
case may be, in the 
policy: 
Provided also that the nomination, which has been automatically cancelled consequent upon the transfer 
or assignment, the same nomination shall stand automatically revived when the policy is reassigned by the 
assignee or retransferred by the transferee in favour of the policyholder on repayment of loan other than on 
a security of policy to the insurer. 
(5) Where the policy matures for payment during the lifetime of the person whose life is insured or 
where the nominee or, if there are more nominees than one, all the nominees die before the policy  matures 
for payment, the amount secured by the policy shall be payable to the policyholder or his heirs or legal 
representatives or the holder of a succession certificate, as the case may be. 
(6) Where the nominee or if there are more nominees than one, a nominee or nominees survive the 
person whose life is insured, the amount secured by the policy shall be payable to such survivor or survivors.55 
 
(7) Subject to the other provisions of this section, where the holder of a policy of insurance on his own 
life nominates his parents, or his spouse, or his children, or his spouse and children, or any of them, the 
nominee or nominees shall be beneficially entitled to the amount payable by the insurer to him or them 
under sub-section (6) unless it is proved that the holder of the policy, having regard to the nature of his title 
to the policy, could not have conferred any such beneficial title on the nominee. 
(8) Subject as aforesaid, where the nominee, or if there are more nominees than one, a nominee or 
nominees, to whom sub-section (7) applies, die after the person whose life is insured but before the amount 
secured by the policy is paid, the amount secured by the policy, or so much of the amount secured by the 
policy as represents the share of the nominee or nominees so dying (as the case may be), shall be payable 
to the heirs or legal representatives of the nominee or nominees or the holder of a succession certificate, as 
the case may be, and they shall be beneficially entitled to such amount. 
(9) Nothing in sub-sections (7) and (8) shall operate to destroy or impede the right of any creditor to be 
paid out of the proceeds of any policy of life 
insurance. 
(10) The provisions of sub-sections (7) and (8) shall apply to all policies of life insurance maturing for 
payment after the commencement of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015 (5 of

has not been made to him because of his death, in such a case, his nominee shall be entitled to the proceeds 
and benefit of his policy.

the Married Women’s Property Act, 1874 (3 of 1874), applies or has at any 
time applied:

Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015 (5 of 2015), in favour of the wife of the person who has insured his life or 
of his wife and children or any of them is expressed, whether or not on the face of the policy, as being made

circumstances admit.

as the principal company to which it is alleged to be secondary, the 2[Tribunal] shall not direct the secondary 
company to be wound up, unless, after hearing all objections (if any) that may be urged by or on behalf of

principal company and that the winding up of the company in conjunction with the principal company is

holders in respect of their policies and for the manner of winding up any of the affairs of the company which 
are proposed to be wound up and may contain provisions for altering the memorandum  of the company 
with respect to its objects and such further provisions as may be expedient for giving effect to the scheme.
