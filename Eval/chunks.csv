When human life is lost or a \nperson is disabled permanently or temporarily, there \nis loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary \nsum could be determined based on the loss of \nincome in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the \nSum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid \nin the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life \nInsurance products provide a definite amount of \nmoney in case the life insured dies during the term of \nthe policy or becomes disabled on account of an \naccident.\n Why you should buy Life Insurance:\nAll of us face the following risks:\nDying too soon\nLiving too long\nLife Insurance is needed :\nTo ensure that your immediate family has some \nfinancial support in the event of your demise\nTo finance your children’s education and other \nneeds\nTo have a savings plan for the future so that you \nhave a constant source of income after retirement\nTo ensure that you have extra income when your \nearnings are reduced due to serious illness or\naccident\nTo provide for other financial contingencies and life \nstyle requirements\n Who needs Life Insurance:\nPrimarily, anyone who has a family to support and is \nan income earner needs Life Insurance.

Whole life insurance pays out a \ndeath benefit so you can be assured that your family \nis protected against financial loss that can happen \nafter your death. It is also an ideal way of creating an \nestate for your heirs as an inheritance.\nEndowment Policy\nAn Endowment Policy is a savings linked insurance \npolicy with a specific maturity date. Should an \nunfortunate event by way of death or disability occur \nto you during the period, the Sum Assuredwill be \npaid to your beneficiaries. On your surviving the \nterm, the maturity proceeds on the policy become \npayable.\nMoney back plans or cash back plans: \nUnder this plan, certain percent of the sum assured is \nreturned to the insured person periodically as \nsurvival benefit. On the expiry of the term, the balance \namount is paid as maturity value.The life risk may \nbe covered for the full sum assured during the term \nof the policy irrespective of the survival benefits \npaid.\nChildren Policies\nThese types of policies are taken on the life of the \nparent/children for the benefit of the child.By such \npolicy the parent can plan to get funds when the \nchild attains various stages in life.

He has the option to \npay as single premium also. The fund will \naccumulate with interest and fund will be available \non the vesting date. The insurance company will \ntake care of the investment of funds and the \npolicyholder has the option to encash 1/3rd of this \ncorpus fund on the vesting age / vesting date tax \nfree. The balance amount of 2/3rd of the fund will be \nutilized for purchase of Annuity (pension) to the \nAnnuitant.\nUnit Linked Insurance Policy\nUnit Linked Insurance Policies (ULIPs) offer a \ncombination of investment and protection and\nallow you the flexibility and choice on how your \npremiums are invested. IN UNIT LINKED PLANS, \nTHE INVESTMENT RISK PORTFOLIO IS \nBORNE BY YOU AS YOU ARE THE INVESTOR \nTypically, the policy will provide you with a choice of \nfunds in which you may invest. You also have the \nflexibility to switch between different funds during \nthe life of the policy. The value of a ULIP is linked to \nthe prevailing value of units you have invested in', 'the fund, which in turn depends on the fund’s \nperformance.

A ULIP has varying \ndegrees of risk and rewards. There are various \ncharges applicable for Unit Linked Policies and the \nbalance amount out of the premium is only invested \nin the fund/funds chosen by you.It is important to \nask your insurer or agent or broker questions to \nunderstand the sum total of charges that you have to \nincur.

Paid up Value = No. of Premiums \nPaid / No. of Premiums Payable X S.A=10/20 X= 50000/-.This means that the policy is \neffective as before except that from the date the th premium was due, the sum assured is 50,000/- \ninstead of original 1,00,000/-.To this sum assured \nthe bonus already vested (accrued) before the \npolicy lapsed, is also added.Example if the bonus \naccrued up to the date of lapse is 35,000/-, the total \npaid up value is 50000 + 35000 = 85000.\n Q.\nHow is Surrender Value calculated in \nConventional Life Insurance Policy?\nA.\nSurrender Value is allowed as a percentage of this \npaid up value.Surrender value is calculated as per \nthe surrender value factor, which depends on the \npremiums paid and elapsed duration.\nQ.\nHow is the Loan on Policy calculated under \nConventional Life Insurance Policies?\nA.\nIf the policy conditions permit grant of loan, loan is \nsanctioned as a percentage of the Surrender Value.\nQ.\nWhat are the requirements to be submitted in \ncase of a Maturity Claim?\nA.\nUsually the Insurance Company will send \nintimation attaching the discharge voucher to the \npolicy holder at least 2 to 3 months in advance of', 'the date of maturity of the policy intimating the \nclaim amount payable.The policy bond and the \ndischarge voucher duly signed and witnessed are to \nbe returned to the insurance company immediately \nso that the insurance company will be able to make \npayment.

When human life is lost or a \nperson is disabled permanently or temporarily, there \nis loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary \nsum could be determined based on the loss of \nincome in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the \nSum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid \nin the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life \nInsurance products provide a definite amount of \nmoney in case the life insured dies during the term of \nthe policy or becomes disabled on account of an \naccident.\n Why you should buy Life Insurance:\nAll of us face the following risks:\nDying too soon\nLiving too long\nLife Insurance is needed :\nTo ensure that your immediate family has some \nfinancial support in the event of your demise\nTo finance your children’s education and other \nneeds\nTo have a savings plan for the future so that you \nhave a constant source of income after retirement\nTo ensure that you have extra income when your \nearnings are reduced due to serious illness or\naccident\nTo provide for other financial contingencies and life \nstyle requirements\n Who needs Life Insurance:\nPrimarily, anyone who has a family to support and is \nan income earner needs Life Insurance. In view of \nthe economic value of their contribution to the \nfamily, housewives too need life insurance coverEven children can be considered for life insurance in \nview of their future income potential being at risk.\n How much Life Insurance is needed:\nThe amount of Life Insurance coverage you need \nwill depend on many factors such as:\nHow many dependants you have\nWhether you have any debts or mortgages\nWhat kind of lifestyle you want to provide for your \nfamily\nHow much you need for your children’s education\nWhatyour investment needs are\nWhat your affordability is\nYou should seek the help of an insurance agent or \nbroker to understand your insurance needs and \nsuggest the right type of cover Kinds of Life Insurance Policies:\nTerm Insurance\nYou can choose to have protection for a set period of \ntime with Term Insurance. In the event of death or \nTotal and Permanent Disabilityif the benefit is \noffered), your dependants will be paid a benefit. In \nTerm Insurance, no benefit is normally payable if the \nlife assured survives the term.\nWhole Life Insurance\nWith whole life insurance, you are guaranteed \nlifelong protection. Whole life insurance pays out a \ndeath benefit so you can be assured that your family \nis protected against financial loss that can happen \nafter your death. It is also an ideal way of creating an \nestate for your heirs as an inheritance.\nEndowment Policy\nAn Endowment Policy is a savings linked insurance \npolicy with a specific maturity date. Should an \nunfortunate event by way of death or disability occur \nto you during the period, the Sum Assuredwill be \npaid to your beneficiaries. On your surviving the \nterm, the maturity proceeds on the policy become \npayable.\nMoney back plans or cash back plans: \nUnder this plan, certain percent of the sum assured is \nreturned to the insured person periodically as \nsurvival benefit. On the expiry of the term, the balance \namount is paid as maturity value.The life risk may \nbe covered for the full sum assured during the term \nof the policy irrespective of the survival benefits \npaid.\nChildren Policies\nThese types of policies are taken on the life of the \nparent/children for the benefit of the child.By such \npolicy the parent can plan to get funds when the \nchild attains various stages in life. Some insurers \noffer waiver of premiums in case of unfortunate \ndeath of the parent/proposer during the term of the \npolicyAnnuity (Pension) Plans\nWhen an employee retires he no longer gets his \nsalary while his need for a regular income continuesRetirement benefits like Provident Fund and \ngratuity are paid in lump sum which are often spent \ntoo quickly or not invested prudently with the result \nthat the employee finds himself without regular \nincome in his post - retirement days. Pension is \ntherefore an ideal method of retirement provision', 'because the benefit is in the form of regular incomeIt is wise to provide for old age, when we have \nregular income during our earning period to take \ncare of rainy days. Financial independence during \nold age is a must for everybodyThere are two types of annuities (pension plans).\n Immediate Annuity \nIn case of immediate Annuity, the Annuity payment \nfrom the Insurance Company starts immediatelyPurchase price (premium) for immediate Annuity is \nto be paid in Iumpsum in one installment only Deferred Annuity\nUnder deferred Annuity policy, the person pays \nregular contributions to the Insurance Company, till \nthe vesting age/vesting date. He has the option to \npay as single premium also. The fund will \naccumulate with interest and fund will be available \non the vesting date. The insurance company will \ntake care of the investment of funds and the \npolicyholder has the option to encash 1/3rd of this \ncorpus fund on the vesting age / vesting date tax \nfree. The balance amount of 2/3rd of the fund will be \nutilized for purchase of Annuity (pension) to the \nAnnuitant.\nUnit Linked Insurance Policy\nUnit Linked Insurance Policies (ULIPs) offer a \ncombination of investment and protection and\nallow you the flexibility and choice on how your \npremiums are invested. IN UNIT LINKED PLANS, \nTHE INVESTMENT RISK PORTFOLIO IS \nBORNE BY YOU AS YOU ARE THE INVESTOR \nTypically, the policy will provide you with a choice of \nfunds in which you may invest. You also have the \nflexibility to switch between different funds during \nthe life of the policy. The value of a ULIP is linked to \nthe prevailing value of units you have invested in \nthe fund, which in turn depends on the fund’s \nperformance. In the event of death or permanent \ndisability, the policy will provide the Sum Assured \n(to the extent you are covered) so that you can take \ncomfort in knowing that your family is protected \nfrom sudden financial loss. A ULIP has varying \ndegrees of risk and rewards. There are various \ncharges applicable for Unit Linked Policies and the \nbalance amount out of the premium is only invested \nin the fund/funds chosen by you.It is important to \nask your insurer or agent or broker questions to \nunderstand the sum total of charges that you have to \nincur. It is important to assess your risk appetite and \ninvestment horizon before deciding to buy a ULIP \npolicy.

Paid up Value = No. of Premiums \nPaid / No. of Premiums Payable X S.A=10/20 X= 50000/-.This means that the policy is \neffective as before except that from the date the th premium was due, the sum assured is 50,000/- \ninstead of original 1,00,000/-.To this sum assured \nthe bonus already vested (accrued) before the \npolicy lapsed, is also added.Example if the bonus \naccrued up to the date of lapse is 35,000/-, the total \npaid up value is 50000 + 35000 = 85000.\n Q.\nHow is Surrender Value calculated in \nConventional Life Insurance Policy?\nA.\nSurrender Value is allowed as a percentage of this \npaid up value.Surrender value is calculated as per \nthe surrender value factor, which depends on the \npremiums paid and elapsed duration.\nQ.\nHow is the Loan on Policy calculated under \nConventional Life Insurance Policies?\nA.\nIf the policy conditions permit grant of loan, loan is \nsanctioned as a percentage of the Surrender Value.\nQ.\nWhat are the requirements to be submitted in \ncase of a Maturity Claim?\nA.\nUsually the Insurance Company will send \nintimation attaching the discharge voucher to the \npolicy holder at least 2 to 3 months in advance of \nthe date of maturity of the policy intimating the \nclaim amount payable.The policy bond and the \ndischarge voucher duly signed and witnessed are to \nbe returned to the insurance company immediately \nso that the insurance company will be able to make \npayment.

On the expiry of the term, the balance \namount is paid as maturity value.The life risk may \nbe covered for the full sum assured during the term \nof the policy irrespective of the survival benefits \npaid.\nChildren Policies\nThese types of policies are taken on the life of the \nparent/children for the benefit of the child.By such \npolicy the parent can plan to get funds when the \nchild attains various stages in life.

You also have the \nflexibility to switch between different funds during \nthe life of the policy. The value of a ULIP is linked to \nthe prevailing value of units you have invested in \nthe fund, which in turn depends on the fund’s \nperformance.

Paid up Value = No. of Premiums \nPaid / No. of Premiums Payable X S.A=10/20 X= 50000/-.This means that the policy is \neffective as before except that from the date the th premium was due, the sum assured is 50,000/- \ninstead of original 1,00,000/-.To this sum assured \nthe bonus already vested (accrued) before the \npolicy lapsed, is also added.Example if the bonus \naccrued up to the date of lapse is 35,000/-, the total \npaid up value is 50000 + 35000 = 85000.\n Q.\nHow is Surrender Value calculated in \nConventional Life Insurance Policy?\nA.\nSurrender Value is allowed as a percentage of this \npaid up value.Surrender value is calculated as per \nthe surrender value factor, which depends on the \npremiums paid and elapsed duration.\nQ.\nHow is the Loan on Policy calculated under \nConventional Life Insurance Policies?\nA.\nIf the policy conditions permit grant of loan, loan is \nsanctioned as a percentage of the Surrender Value.\nQ.\nWhat are the requirements to be submitted in \ncase of a Maturity Claim?\nA.\nUsually the Insurance Company will send \nintimation attaching the discharge voucher to the \npolicy holder at least 2 to 3 months in advance of \nthe date of maturity of the policy intimating the \nclaim amount payable.The policy bond and the \ndischarge voucher duly signed and witnessed are to \nbe returned to the insurance company immediately \nso that the insurance company will be able to make \npayment.

Life Insurance\n Life Insurance is a financial cover for a contingency \nlinked with human life, like death, disability, \naccident, retirement etc. Human life is subject to \nrisks of death and disability due to natural and \naccidental causes. When human life is lost or a \nperson is disabled permanently or temporarily, there \nis loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary \nsum could be determined based on the loss of \nincome in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the \nSum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid \nin the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life \nInsurance products provide a definite amount of \nmoney in case the life insured dies during the term of \nthe policy or becomes disabled on account of an \naccident.\n Why you should buy Life Insurance:\nAll of us face the following risks:\nDying too soon\nLiving too long\nLife Insurance is needed :\nTo ensure that your immediate family has some \nfinancial support in the event of your demise\nTo finance your children’s education and other \nneeds\nTo have a savings plan for the future so that you \nhave a constant source of income after retirement\nTo ensure that you have extra income when your \nearnings are reduced due to serious illness or\naccident\nTo provide for other financial contingencies and life \nstyle requirements\n Who needs Life Insurance:\nPrimarily, anyone who has a family to support and is \nan income earner needs Life Insurance. In view of \nthe economic value of their contribution to the \nfamily, housewives too need life insurance coverEven children can be considered for life insurance in \nview of their future income potential being at risk.\n How much Life Insurance is needed:\nThe amount of Life Insurance coverage you need \nwill depend on many factors such as:\nHow many dependants you have\nWhether you have any debts or mortgages\nWhat kind of lifestyle you want to provide for your \nfamily\nHow much you need for your children’s education', 'Whatyour investment needs are\nWhat your affordability is\nYou should seek the help of an insurance agent or \nbroker to understand your insurance needs and \nsuggest the right type of cover Kinds of Life Insurance Policies:\nTerm Insurance\nYou can choose to have protection for a set period of \ntime with Term Insurance. In the event of death or \nTotal and Permanent Disabilityif the benefit is \noffered), your dependants will be paid a benefit. In \nTerm Insurance, no benefit is normally payable if the \nlife assured survives the term.\nWhole Life Insurance\nWith whole life insurance, you are guaranteed \nlifelong protection. Whole life insurance pays out a \ndeath benefit so you can be assured that your family \nis protected against financial loss that can happen \nafter your death. It is also an ideal way of creating an \nestate for your heirs as an inheritance.\nEndowment Policy\nAn Endowment Policy is a savings linked insurance \npolicy with a specific maturity date. Should an \nunfortunate event by way of death or disability occur \nto you during the period, the Sum Assuredwill be \npaid to your beneficiaries. On your surviving the \nterm, the maturity proceeds on the policy become \npayable.\nMoney back plans or cash back plans: \nUnder this plan, certain percent of the sum assured is \nreturned to the insured person periodically as \nsurvival benefit. On the expiry of the term, the balance \namount is paid as maturity value.The life risk may \nbe covered for the full sum assured during the term \nof the policy irrespective of the survival benefits \npaid.\nChildren Policies\nThese types of policies are taken on the life of the \nparent/children for the benefit of the child.By such \npolicy the parent can plan to get funds when the \nchild attains various stages in life. Some insurers \noffer waiver of premiums in case of unfortunate \ndeath of the parent/proposer during the term of the \npolicyAnnuity (Pension) Plans\nWhen an employee retires he no longer gets his', 'salary while his need for a regular income continuesRetirement benefits like Provident Fund and \ngratuity are paid in lump sum which are often spent \ntoo quickly or not invested prudently with the result \nthat the employee finds himself without regular \nincome in his post - retirement days. Pension is \ntherefore an ideal method of retirement provision \nbecause the benefit is in the form of regular incomeIt is wise to provide for old age, when we have \nregular income during our earning period to take \ncare of rainy days. Financial independence during \nold age is a must for everybodyThere are two types of annuities (pension plans).\n Immediate Annuity \nIn case of immediate Annuity, the Annuity payment \nfrom the Insurance Company starts immediatelyPurchase price (premium) for immediate Annuity is \nto be paid in Iumpsum in one installment only Deferred Annuity\nUnder deferred Annuity policy, the person pays \nregular contributions to the Insurance Company, till \nthe vesting age/vesting date. He has the option to \npay as single premium also. The fund will \naccumulate with interest and fund will be available \non the vesting date.

Life Insurance\n Life Insurance is a financial cover for a contingency \nlinked with human life, like death, disability, \naccident, retirement etc. Human life is subject to \nrisks of death and disability due to natural and \naccidental causes. When human life is lost or a \nperson is disabled permanently or temporarily, there \nis loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary \nsum could be determined based on the loss of \nincome in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the \nSum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid \nin the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life \nInsurance products provide a definite amount of \nmoney in case the life insured dies during the term of \nthe policy or becomes disabled on account of an \naccident.\n Why you should buy Life Insurance:\nAll of us face the following risks:\nDying too soon\nLiving too long\nLife Insurance is needed :\nTo ensure that your immediate family has some \nfinancial support in the event of your demise\nTo finance your children’s education and other \nneeds\nTo have a savings plan for the future so that you \nhave a constant source of income after retirement\nTo ensure that you have extra income when your \nearnings are reduced due to serious illness or\naccident\nTo provide for other financial contingencies and life \nstyle requirements\n Who needs Life Insurance:\nPrimarily, anyone who has a family to support and is \nan income earner needs Life Insurance. In view of \nthe economic value of their contribution to the \nfamily, housewives too need life insurance coverEven children can be considered for life insurance in \nview of their future income potential being at risk.\n How much Life Insurance is needed:\nThe amount of Life Insurance coverage you need \nwill depend on many factors such as:\nHow many dependants you have\nWhether you have any debts or mortgages\nWhat kind of lifestyle you want to provide for your \nfamily\nHow much you need for your children’s education\nWhatyour investment needs are\nWhat your affordability is\nYou should seek the help of an insurance agent or \nbroker to understand your insurance needs and \nsuggest the right type of cover Kinds of Life Insurance Policies:\nTerm Insurance\nYou can choose to have protection for a set period of \ntime with Term Insurance. In the event of death or \nTotal and Permanent Disabilityif the benefit is \noffered), your dependants will be paid a benefit. In \nTerm Insurance, no benefit is normally payable if the \nlife assured survives the term.\nWhole Life Insurance\nWith whole life insurance, you are guaranteed \nlifelong protection. Whole life insurance pays out a \ndeath benefit so you can be assured that your family \nis protected against financial loss that can happen \nafter your death. It is also an ideal way of creating an \nestate for your heirs as an inheritance.\nEndowment Policy\nAn Endowment Policy is a savings linked insurance \npolicy with a specific maturity date. Should an \nunfortunate event by way of death or disability occur \nto you during the period, the Sum Assuredwill be \npaid to your beneficiaries. On your surviving the \nterm, the maturity proceeds on the policy become \npayable.\nMoney back plans or cash back plans: \nUnder this plan, certain percent of the sum assured is \nreturned to the insured person periodically as \nsurvival benefit. On the expiry of the term, the balance \namount is paid as maturity value.The life risk may \nbe covered for the full sum assured during the term \nof the policy irrespective of the survival benefits \npaid.\nChildren Policies\nThese types of policies are taken on the life of the \nparent/children for the benefit of the child.By such \npolicy the parent can plan to get funds when the \nchild attains various stages in life. Some insurers \noffer waiver of premiums in case of unfortunate \ndeath of the parent/proposer during the term of the \npolicyAnnuity (Pension) Plans\nWhen an employee retires he no longer gets his \nsalary while his need for a regular income continuesRetirement benefits like Provident Fund and \ngratuity are paid in lump sum which are often spent \ntoo quickly or not invested prudently with the result \nthat the employee finds himself without regular \nincome in his post - retirement days. Pension is \ntherefore an ideal method of retirement provision \nbecause the benefit is in the form of regular incomeIt is wise to provide for old age, when we have \nregular income during our earning period to take \ncare of rainy days. Financial independence during \nold age is a must for everybodyThere are two types of annuities (pension plans).\n Immediate Annuity \nIn case of immediate Annuity, the Annuity payment \nfrom the Insurance Company starts immediatelyPurchase price (premium) for immediate Annuity is \nto be paid in Iumpsum in one installment only Deferred Annuity\nUnder deferred Annuity policy, the person pays \nregular contributions to the Insurance Company, till \nthe vesting age/vesting date. He has the option to \npay as single premium also. The fund will \naccumulate with interest and fund will be available \non the vesting date. The insurance company will \ntake care of the investment of funds and the \npolicyholder has the option to encash 1/3rd of this \ncorpus fund on the vesting age / vesting date tax \nfree. The balance amount of 2/3rd of the fund will be \nutilized for purchase of Annuity (pension) to the \nAnnuitant.\nUnit Linked Insurance Policy\nUnit Linked Insurance Policies (ULIPs) offer a \ncombination of investment and protection and\nallow you the flexibility and choice on how your \npremiums are invested. IN UNIT LINKED PLANS, \nTHE INVESTMENT RISK PORTFOLIO IS \nBORNE BY YOU AS YOU ARE THE INVESTOR \nTypically, the policy will provide you with a choice of \nfunds in which you may invest. You also have the \nflexibility to switch between different funds during \nthe life of the policy. The value of a ULIP is linked to \nthe prevailing value of units you have invested in \nthe fund, which in turn depends on the fund’s \nperformance. In the event of death or permanent \ndisability, the policy will provide the Sum Assured \n(to the extent you are covered) so that you can take \ncomfort in knowing that your family is protected \nfrom sudden financial loss. A ULIP has varying \ndegrees of risk and rewards. There are various \ncharges applicable for Unit Linked Policies and the \nbalance amount out of the premium is only invested \nin the fund/funds chosen by you.It is important to \nask your insurer or agent or broker questions to \nunderstand the sum total of charges that you have to \nincur. It is important to assess your risk appetite and \ninvestment horizon before deciding to buy a ULIP \npolicy. You must also read the terms and conditions \nof the policy carefully to understand the features of \nthe policy including the lock-in period, surrender \nvalue, surrender charges etc.\nAll the types of plans mentioned above can be \noffered under ULIP plans..\nFAQs on Life Insurance\nCONVENTIONAL LIFE INSURANCE\nQWhat should I look for before I decide to buy a \npolicy ?\nAYou must check and see whether or not there is \navailability of guarantee of return,what the lock in \nperiod is,details of premiumto be paid, what \nwould be implications of premium default,what \nthe revival conditions are what thepolicy terms \nare, what are the charges that would be deducted, \nwould loan be available etc\nQWhat is the importance of a proposal and the \ndisclosures made therein ?\nA.\nThe disclosures made in a proposal are the basis for \nunderwriting a policy and therefore any wrong \nstatements or disclosures can lead to denial of a \nclaim.\nQWhat are special medical reports required to be \nsubmitted in Life insurance?\nA.\nIn case of certain proposals, depending upon the \nage of entry, age at maturity, sum assured, family \nhistory and personal history, special medical reports \nmay be necessary for consideration of a risk.

Paid up Value = No. of Premiums \nPaid / No. of Premiums Payable X S.A=10/20 X= 50000/-.This means that the policy is \neffective as before except that from the date the th premium was due, the sum assured is 50,000/- \ninstead of original 1,00,000/-.To this sum assured \nthe bonus already vested (accrued) before the \npolicy lapsed, is also added.Example if the bonus \naccrued up to the date of lapse is 35,000/-, the total \npaid up value is 50000 + 35000 = 85000.\n Q.\nHow is Surrender Value calculated in \nConventional Life Insurance Policy?\nA.\nSurrender Value is allowed as a percentage of this \npaid up value.Surrender value is calculated as per \nthe surrender value factor, which depends on the \npremiums paid and elapsed duration.\nQ.\nHow is the Loan on Policy calculated under \nConventional Life Insurance Policies?\nA.\nIf the policy conditions permit grant of loan, loan is \nsanctioned as a percentage of the Surrender Value.\nQ.\nWhat are the requirements to be submitted in \ncase of a Maturity Claim?\nA.\nUsually the Insurance Company will send \nintimation attaching the discharge voucher to the \npolicy holder at least 2 to 3 months in advance of \nthe date of maturity of the policy intimating the \nclaim amount payable.The policy bond and the \ndischarge voucher duly signed and witnessed are to \nbe returned to the insurance company immediately \nso that the insurance company will be able to make \npayment. If the policy is assigned in favour of any \nother person the claim amount will be paid only to \nthe assignee who will give the discharge\n QWhat is meant by settlement options?\nA.\nSettlement option means the facility made \navailable to the policy holder to receive the \nmaturity proceeds in a defined manner (the terms \nand conditions are specified in advance at the \ninception of the contract).\nQWhat documents aregenerally required to be \nsubmitted in case of death of life assured while \nthe policy is in force?\nA.\nThe basic documents that are generally required \nare death certificate, claim formand policy bond,\nOther documents such as medical attendant’s \ncertificate, hospital certificate, employer’s \ncertificate, police inquest report, post mortem \nreport etc could be called for, as applicable.

When human life is lost or a \nperson is disabled permanently or temporarily, there \nis loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary \nsum could be determined based on the loss of \nincome in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the \nSum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid \nin the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life \nInsurance products provide a definite amount of \nmoney in case the life insured dies during the term of \nthe policy or becomes disabled on account of an \naccident.\n Why you should buy Life Insurance:\nAll of us face the following risks:\nDying too soon\nLiving too long\nLife Insurance is needed :\nTo ensure that your immediate family has some \nfinancial support in the event of your demise\nTo finance your children’s education and other \nneeds\nTo have a savings plan for the future so that you \nhave a constant source of income after retirement\nTo ensure that you have extra income when your \nearnings are reduced due to serious illness or\naccident\nTo provide for other financial contingencies and life \nstyle requirements\n Who needs Life Insurance:\nPrimarily, anyone who has a family to support and is \nan income earner needs Life Insurance.

Whole life insurance pays out a \ndeath benefit so you can be assured that your family \nis protected against financial loss that can happen \nafter your death. It is also an ideal way of creating an \nestate for your heirs as an inheritance.\nEndowment Policy\nAn Endowment Policy is a savings linked insurance \npolicy with a specific maturity date.

On your surviving the \nterm, the maturity proceeds on the policy become \npayable.\nMoney back plans or cash back plans: \nUnder this plan, certain percent of the sum assured is \nreturned to the insured person periodically as \nsurvival benefit. On the expiry of the term, the balance \namount is paid as maturity value.The life risk may \nbe covered for the full sum assured during the term \nof the policy irrespective of the survival benefits \npaid.\nChildren Policies\nThese types of policies are taken on the life of the \nparent/children for the benefit of the child.By such \npolicy the parent can plan to get funds when the \nchild attains various stages in life.

He has the option to \npay as single premium also. The fund will \naccumulate with interest and fund will be available \non the vesting date. The insurance company will \ntake care of the investment of funds and the \npolicyholder has the option to encash 1/3rd of this \ncorpus fund on the vesting age / vesting date tax \nfree. The balance amount of 2/3rd of the fund will be \nutilized for purchase of Annuity (pension) to the \nAnnuitant.\nUnit Linked Insurance Policy\nUnit Linked Insurance Policies (ULIPs) offer a \ncombination of investment and protection and\nallow you the flexibility and choice on how your \npremiums are invested.

Paid up Value = No. of Premiums \nPaid / No. of Premiums Payable X S.A=10/20 X= 50000/-.This means that the policy is \neffective as before except that from the date the th premium was due, the sum assured is 50,000/- \ninstead of original 1,00,000/-.To this sum assured \nthe bonus already vested (accrued) before the \npolicy lapsed, is also added.Example if the bonus \naccrued up to the date of lapse is 35,000/-, the total \npaid up value is 50000 + 35000 = 85000.\n Q.\nHow is Surrender Value calculated in \nConventional Life Insurance Policy?\nA.\nSurrender Value is allowed as a percentage of this \npaid up value.Surrender value is calculated as per \nthe surrender value factor, which depends on the \npremiums paid and elapsed duration.\nQ.\nHow is the Loan on Policy calculated under \nConventional Life Insurance Policies?\nA.\nIf the policy conditions permit grant of loan, loan is \nsanctioned as a percentage of the Surrender Value.\nQ.\nWhat are the requirements to be submitted in \ncase of a Maturity Claim?\nA.\nUsually the Insurance Company will send \nintimation attaching the discharge voucher to the \npolicy holder at least 2 to 3 months in advance of', 'the date of maturity of the policy intimating the \nclaim amount payable.The policy bond and the \ndischarge voucher duly signed and witnessed are to \nbe returned to the insurance company immediately \nso that the insurance company will be able to make \npayment.

Life Insurance\n Life Insurance is a financial cover for a contingency \nlinked with human life, like death, disability, \naccident, retirement etc. Human life is subject to \nrisks of death and disability due to natural and \naccidental causes. When human life is lost or a \nperson is disabled permanently or temporarily, there \nis loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary \nsum could be determined based on the loss of \nincome in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the \nSum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid \nin the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life \nInsurance products provide a definite amount of \nmoney in case the life insured dies during the term of \nthe policy or becomes disabled on account of an \naccident.\n Why you should buy Life Insurance:\nAll of us face the following risks:\nDying too soon\nLiving too long\nLife Insurance is needed :\nTo ensure that your immediate family has some \nfinancial support in the event of your demise\nTo finance your children’s education and other \nneeds\nTo have a savings plan for the future so that you \nhave a constant source of income after retirement\nTo ensure that you have extra income when your \nearnings are reduced due to serious illness or\naccident\nTo provide for other financial contingencies and life \nstyle requirements\n Who needs Life Insurance:\nPrimarily, anyone who has a family to support and is \nan income earner needs Life Insurance. In view of \nthe economic value of their contribution to the \nfamily, housewives too need life insurance coverEven children can be considered for life insurance in \nview of their future income potential being at risk.\n How much Life Insurance is needed:\nThe amount of Life Insurance coverage you need \nwill depend on many factors such as:\nHow many dependants you have\nWhether you have any debts or mortgages\nWhat kind of lifestyle you want to provide for your \nfamily\nHow much you need for your children’s education\nWhatyour investment needs are\nWhat your affordability is\nYou should seek the help of an insurance agent or \nbroker to understand your insurance needs and \nsuggest the right type of cover Kinds of Life Insurance Policies:\nTerm Insurance\nYou can choose to have protection for a set period of \ntime with Term Insurance. In the event of death or \nTotal and Permanent Disabilityif the benefit is \noffered), your dependants will be paid a benefit. In \nTerm Insurance, no benefit is normally payable if the \nlife assured survives the term.\nWhole Life Insurance\nWith whole life insurance, you are guaranteed \nlifelong protection. Whole life insurance pays out a \ndeath benefit so you can be assured that your family \nis protected against financial loss that can happen \nafter your death. It is also an ideal way of creating an \nestate for your heirs as an inheritance.\nEndowment Policy\nAn Endowment Policy is a savings linked insurance \npolicy with a specific maturity date. Should an \nunfortunate event by way of death or disability occur \nto you during the period, the Sum Assuredwill be \npaid to your beneficiaries. On your surviving the \nterm, the maturity proceeds on the policy become \npayable.\nMoney back plans or cash back plans: \nUnder this plan, certain percent of the sum assured is \nreturned to the insured person periodically as \nsurvival benefit. On the expiry of the term, the balance \namount is paid as maturity value.The life risk may \nbe covered for the full sum assured during the term \nof the policy irrespective of the survival benefits \npaid.\nChildren Policies\nThese types of policies are taken on the life of the \nparent/children for the benefit of the child.By such \npolicy the parent can plan to get funds when the \nchild attains various stages in life. Some insurers \noffer waiver of premiums in case of unfortunate \ndeath of the parent/proposer during the term of the \npolicyAnnuity (Pension) Plans\nWhen an employee retires he no longer gets his \nsalary while his need for a regular income continuesRetirement benefits like Provident Fund and \ngratuity are paid in lump sum which are often spent \ntoo quickly or not invested prudently with the result \nthat the employee finds himself without regular \nincome in his post - retirement days. Pension is \ntherefore an ideal method of retirement provision \nbecause the benefit is in the form of regular incomeIt is wise to provide for old age, when we have \nregular income during our earning period to take \ncare of rainy days. Financial independence during \nold age is a must for everybodyThere are two types of annuities (pension plans).\n Immediate Annuity \nIn case of immediate Annuity, the Annuity payment \nfrom the Insurance Company starts immediatelyPurchase price (premium) for immediate Annuity is \nto be paid in Iumpsum in one installment only Deferred Annuity\nUnder deferred Annuity policy, the person pays \nregular contributions to the Insurance Company, till \nthe vesting age/vesting date. He has the option to \npay as single premium also. The fund will \naccumulate with interest and fund will be available \non the vesting date. The insurance company will \ntake care of the investment of funds and the \npolicyholder has the option to encash 1/3rd of this \ncorpus fund on the vesting age / vesting date tax \nfree. The balance amount of 2/3rd of the fund will be \nutilized for purchase of Annuity (pension) to the \nAnnuitant.\nUnit Linked Insurance Policy\nUnit Linked Insurance Policies (ULIPs) offer a \ncombination of investment and protection and\nallow you the flexibility and choice on how your \npremiums are invested. IN UNIT LINKED PLANS, \nTHE INVESTMENT RISK PORTFOLIO IS \nBORNE BY YOU AS YOU ARE THE INVESTOR \nTypically, the policy will provide you with a choice of \nfunds in which you may invest. You also have the \nflexibility to switch between different funds during \nthe life of the policy. The value of a ULIP is linked to \nthe prevailing value of units you have invested in \nthe fund, which in turn depends on the fund’s \nperformance. In the event of death or permanent \ndisability, the policy will provide the Sum Assured \n(to the extent you are covered) so that you can take \ncomfort in knowing that your family is protected \nfrom sudden financial loss. A ULIP has varying \ndegrees of risk and rewards. There are various \ncharges applicable for Unit Linked Policies and the \nbalance amount out of the premium is only invested \nin the fund/funds chosen by you.It is important to \nask your insurer or agent or broker questions to \nunderstand the sum total of charges that you have to \nincur. It is important to assess your risk appetite and \ninvestment horizon before deciding to buy a ULIP \npolicy. You must also read the terms and conditions \nof the policy carefully to understand the features of \nthe policy including the lock-in period, surrender \nvalue, surrender charges etc.\nAll the types of plans mentioned above can be \noffered under ULIP plans..\nFAQs on Life Insurance\nCONVENTIONAL LIFE INSURANCE\nQWhat should I look for before I decide to buy a \npolicy ?\nAYou must check and see whether or not there is \navailability of guarantee of return,what the lock in \nperiod is,details of premiumto be paid, what \nwould be implications of premium default,what \nthe revival conditions are what thepolicy terms \nare, what are the charges that would be deducted, \nwould loan be available etc\nQWhat is the importance of a proposal and the \ndisclosures made therein ?\nA.\nThe disclosures made in a proposal are the basis for \nunderwriting a policy and therefore any wrong \nstatements or disclosures can lead to denial of a \nclaim.\nQWhat are special medical reports required to be \nsubmitted in Life insurance?\nA.\nIn case of certain proposals, depending upon the \nage of entry, age at maturity, sum assured, family \nhistory and personal history, special medical reports \nmay be necessary for consideration of a risk.

Paid up Value = No. of Premiums \nPaid / No. of Premiums Payable X S.A=10/20 X= 50000/-.This means that the policy is \neffective as before except that from the date the th premium was due, the sum assured is 50,000/- \ninstead of original 1,00,000/-.To this sum assured \nthe bonus already vested (accrued) before the \npolicy lapsed, is also added.Example if the bonus \naccrued up to the date of lapse is 35,000/-, the total \npaid up value is 50000 + 35000 = 85000.\n Q.\nHow is Surrender Value calculated in \nConventional Life Insurance Policy?\nA.\nSurrender Value is allowed as a percentage of this \npaid up value.Surrender value is calculated as per \nthe surrender value factor, which depends on the \npremiums paid and elapsed duration.\nQ.\nHow is the Loan on Policy calculated under \nConventional Life Insurance Policies?\nA.\nIf the policy conditions permit grant of loan, loan is \nsanctioned as a percentage of the Surrender Value.\nQ.\nWhat are the requirements to be submitted in \ncase of a Maturity Claim?\nA.\nUsually the Insurance Company will send \nintimation attaching the discharge voucher to the \npolicy holder at least 2 to 3 months in advance of \nthe date of maturity of the policy intimating the \nclaim amount payable.The policy bond and the \ndischarge voucher duly signed and witnessed are to \nbe returned to the insurance company immediately \nso that the insurance company will be able to make \npayment. If the policy is assigned in favour of any \nother person the claim amount will be paid only to \nthe assignee who will give the discharge\n QWhat is meant by settlement options?\nA.\nSettlement option means the facility made \navailable to the policy holder to receive the \nmaturity proceeds in a defined manner (the terms \nand conditions are specified in advance at the \ninception of the contract).\nQWhat documents aregenerally required to be \nsubmitted in case of death of life assured while \nthe policy is in force?\nA.\nThe basic documents that are generally required \nare death certificate, claim formand policy bond,\nOther documents such as medical attendant’s \ncertificate, hospital certificate, employer’s \ncertificate, police inquest report, post mortem \nreport etc could be called for, as applicable.

Paid up Value = No. of Premiums \nPaid / No. of Premiums Payable X S.A=10/20 X= 50000/-.This means that the policy is \neffective as before except that from the date the th premium was due, the sum assured is 50,000/- \ninstead of original 1,00,000/-.To this sum assured \nthe bonus already vested (accrued) before the \npolicy lapsed, is also added.Example if the bonus \naccrued up to the date of lapse is 35,000/-, the total \npaid up value is 50000 + 35000 = 85000.\n Q.\nHow is Surrender Value calculated in \nConventional Life Insurance Policy?\nA.\nSurrender Value is allowed as a percentage of this \npaid up value.Surrender value is calculated as per \nthe surrender value factor, which depends on the \npremiums paid and elapsed duration.\nQ.\nHow is the Loan on Policy calculated under \nConventional Life Insurance Policies?\nA.\nIf the policy conditions permit grant of loan, loan is \nsanctioned as a percentage of the Surrender Value.\nQ.\nWhat are the requirements to be submitted in \ncase of a Maturity Claim?\nA.\nUsually the Insurance Company will send \nintimation attaching the discharge voucher to the \npolicy holder at least 2 to 3 months in advance of \nthe date of maturity of the policy intimating the \nclaim amount payable.The policy bond and the \ndischarge voucher duly signed and witnessed are to \nbe returned to the insurance company immediately \nso that the insurance company will be able to make \npayment.
