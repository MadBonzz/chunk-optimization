Q.
What is meant by Paid-up Value in Conventional 
Life Insurance Policy?
A.
After premiums are paid for a certain defined 
period or beyond and if subsequent premiums are 
not paid, the sum assured is reduced to a 
proportionate sum, which bears the same ratio to 
the full sum assured as the number of premiums 
actually paid bears to the total number originally 
stipulated in the policy.For example, if sum 
assured is 1 lakh and the total number of premiums 
is payable is 20 (20 years policy, mode of premium is 
assumed yearly) and default occurs after 10 yearly 
premiums are paid, the policy acquires the paid up 
value of 50,000/-. Paid up Value = No. of Premiums 
Paid / No. of Premiums Payable X S.A=10/20 X= 50000/-.This means that the policy is 
effective as before except that from the date the th premium was due, the sum assured is 50,000/- 
instead of original 1,00,000/-.To this sum assured 
the bonus already vested (accrued) before the 
policy lapsed, is also added.Example if the bonus 
accrued up to the date of lapse is 35,000/-, the total 
paid up value is 50000 + 35000 = 85000.

 Life Insurance is a financial cover for a contingency 
linked with human life, like death, disability, 
accident, retirement etc. Human life is subject to 
risks of death and disability due to natural and 
accidental causes. When human life is lost or a 
person is disabled permanently or temporarily, there 
is loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary 
sum could be determined based on the loss of 
income in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the 
Sum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid 
in the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life 
Insurance products provide a definite amount of 
money in case the life insured dies during the term of 
the policy or becomes disabled on account of an 
accident.
 Why you should buy Life Insurance:
All of us face the following risks:
Dying too soon
Living too long
Life Insurance is needed :
To ensure that your immediate family has some 
financial support in the event of your demise
To finance your children’s education and other 
needs
To have a savings plan for the future so that you 
have a constant source of income after retirement
To ensure that you have extra income when your 
earnings are reduced due to serious illness or
accident
To provide for other financial contingencies and life 
style requirements
 Who needs Life Insurance:
Primarily, anyone who has a family to support and is 
an income earner needs Life Insurance. In view of 
the economic value of their contribution to the 
family, housewives too need life insurance coverEven children can be considered for life insurance in 
view of their future income potential being at risk.
 How much Life Insurance is needed:
The amount of Life Insurance coverage you need 
will depend on many factors such as:
How many dependants you have
Whether you have any debts or mortgages
What kind of lifestyle you want to provide for your 
family
How much you need for your children’s education
Whatyour investment needs are
What your affordability is
You should seek the help of an insurance agent or 
broker to understand your insurance needs and 
suggest the right type of cover Kinds of Life Insurance Policies:
Term Insurance
You can choose to have protection for a set period of 
time with Term Insurance. In the event of death or 
Total and Permanent Disabilityif the benefit is 
offered), your dependants will be paid a benefit. In 
Term Insurance, no benefit is normally payable if the 
life assured survives the term.
Whole Life Insurance
With whole life insurance, you are guaranteed 
lifelong protection. Whole life insurance pays out a 
death benefit so you can be assured that your family 
is protected against financial loss that can happen 
after your death. It is also an ideal way of creating an 
estate for your heirs as an inheritance.
Endowment Policy
An Endowment Policy is a savings linked insurance 
policy with a specific maturity date. Should an 
unfortunate event by way of death or disability occur 
to you during the period, the Sum Assuredwill be 
paid to your beneficiaries. On your surviving the 
term, the maturity proceeds on the policy become 
payable.
Money back plans or cash back plans: 
Under this plan, certain percent of the sum assured is 
returned to the insured person periodically as 
survival benefit. On the expiry of the term, the balance

 Life Insurance is a financial cover for a contingency 
linked with human life, like death, disability, 
accident, retirement etc. Human life is subject to 
risks of death and disability due to natural and 
accidental causes. When human life is lost or a 
person is disabled permanently or temporarily, there 
is loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary 
sum could be determined based on the loss of 
income in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the 
Sum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid 
in the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life 
Insurance products provide a definite amount of 
money in case the life insured dies during the term of 
the policy or becomes disabled on account of an 
accident.

 Life Insurance is a financial cover for a contingency 
linked with human life, like death, disability, 
accident, retirement etc. Human life is subject to 
risks of death and disability due to natural and 
accidental causes. When human life is lost or a 
person is disabled permanently or temporarily, there 
is loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary 
sum could be determined based on the loss of 
income in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the 
Sum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid 
in the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life 
Insurance products provide a definite amount of 
money in case the life insured dies during the term of 
the policy or becomes disabled on account of an 
accident.

too quickly or not invested prudently with the result 
that the employee finds himself without regular 
income in his post - retirement days. Pension is

 Life Insurance is a financial cover for a contingency 
linked with human life, like death, disability, 
accident, retirement etc. Human life is subject to 
risks of death and disability due to natural and 
accidental causes. When human life is lost or a 
person is disabled permanently or temporarily, there 
is loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary 
sum could be determined based on the loss of 
income in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the 
Sum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid 
in the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life 
Insurance products provide a definite amount of 
money in case the life insured dies during the term of 
the policy or becomes disabled on account of an 
accident.

 Life Insurance is a financial cover for a contingency 
linked with human life, like death, disability, 
accident, retirement etc. Human life is subject to 
risks of death and disability due to natural and 
accidental causes. When human life is lost or a 
person is disabled permanently or temporarily, there 
is loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary 
sum could be determined based on the loss of 
income in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the 
Sum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid 
in the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life 
Insurance products provide a definite amount of 
money in case the life insured dies during the term of

proportionate sum, which bears the same ratio to 
the full sum assured as the number of premiums 
actually paid bears to the total number originally 
stipulated in the policy.For example, if sum 
assured is 1 lakh and the total number of premiums 
is payable is 20 (20 years policy, mode of premium is 
assumed yearly) and default occurs after 10 yearly 
premiums are paid, the policy acquires the paid up 
value of 50,000/-. Paid up Value = No. of Premiums 
Paid / No. of Premiums Payable X S.A=10/20 X= 50000/-.This means that the policy is 
effective as before except that from the date the th premium was due, the sum assured is 50,000/- 
instead of original 1,00,000/-.To this sum assured 
the bonus already vested (accrued) before the 
policy lapsed, is also added.Example if the bonus 
accrued up to the date of lapse is 35,000/-, the total 
paid up value is 50000 + 35000 = 85000.

 Life Insurance is a financial cover for a contingency 
linked with human life, like death, disability, 
accident, retirement etc. Human life is subject to 
risks of death and disability due to natural and 
accidental causes. When human life is lost or a 
person is disabled permanently or temporarily, there 
is loss of income to the household Though human life cannot be valued, a monetary 
sum could be determined based on the loss of 
income in future years. Hence, in life insurance, the 
Sum Assured ( or the amount guaranteed to be paid 
in the event of a loss) is by way of a ‘benefit’.Life 
Insurance products provide a definite amount of 
money in case the life insured dies during the term of 
the policy or becomes disabled on account of an 
accident.

effective as before except that from the date the th premium was due, the sum assured is 50,000/- 
instead of original 1,00,000/-.To this sum assured 
the bonus already vested (accrued) before the
